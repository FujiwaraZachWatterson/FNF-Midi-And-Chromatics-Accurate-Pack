# Welcome!

Welcome to Friday Night Funkin' Midi & Chromatics, where most of them are accurate (whether it was made by me or other as "consider borrowed")

## Notice

- Depending on the file, some of them are from other source (e.g. Gamebanana, Drive, Other repo, etc.)
- Some of the file are moderated by me (either midi or converting chromatics into something else)
- If you own some of the source and wanted to remove it from this repo, please let me know first before I can remove it. (By making a new issue through the tab "Issues")
- I may not able to mention the original creator. Because why? Because I can't mistaken the place whether which source who's belong (unless the file was made by me)

## Categories

There's only 2, seperated between midi and chromatics

### Midi Source

This Midi Source contains most of the midi from the Friday Night Funkin' and other FNF Mods. There is also a non-FNF Midi (it may contain a copyright)

- Some of the Midi are self-made or moderated to make it accurate enough.
- Some of the Midi are from other source, even if I moderated to make it accurate or organizing.
- All midi is full organized to avoid confusion, it comes with the BPM and Alternative Midi for characters/chromatics depended on. That's included remix version.
- All midi edited with FL Studio.

### Chromatic Source

This Chromatic Source contains most of the chromatics/soundfonts/directwaves from the other source. There is also a non-FNF Chromatics (it may only contain a series/movie that I only idolized)

- Most of the FNF Chromatics are from other source, even if I converted into soundfonts/directwave.
- All of the non-FNF Chromatics are self-made.
- All chromatic is full organized to avoid confusion, it comes with the different version or preset for songs depended on. That's included sample and plugin version.
